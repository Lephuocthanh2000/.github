# GitOps CI/CD Pipeline Overview

This organization provides reference implementations for applications that are Continuously Integrated and Deployed using a GitOps-based approach via [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), leveraging separate repositories for application code, infrastructure configuration, and deployment logic.

## Repositories Structure

- [[app]](https://github.com/gitops-ci-cd/acme-node) Repository

    Contains the source code for the application, including any workflows. Tags and releases are created here for production deployments. PRs labeled appropriately trigger preview deployments via Argo CD. See [argo-config](https://github.com/gitops-ci-cd/argo-config/blob/main/app-of-apps/apps/) for more information.

    Use this template [TODO]().

- [[app]-infra](https://github.com/gitops-ci-cd/acme-node-infra) Repository

    Manages infrastructure resources specific to the application, such as storage or queues, keeping infrastructure configuration separate from application code.

    Use this template [TODO]().

- [[app]-addon](https://github.com/gitops-ci-cd/node-feature-discovery-addon) Repository

    Manages Kubernetes addons and configurations that enhance the cluster's functionality. These repositories are auto discovered by Argo CD for continuous deployment to all clusters. See [argo-config](https://github.com/gitops-ci-cd/argo-config/blob/main/app-of-apps/addons/) for more information.

    Use this template [TODO]().

- [[app]-deployment](https://github.com/gitops-ci-cd/acme-node-deployment) Repository

    Holds deployment manifests and configuration files for the application. These repositories are auto discovered by Argo CD for continuous deployment to their applicable environments. See [argo-config](https://github.com/gitops-ci-cd/argo-config/blob/main/app-of-apps/apps/) for more information.

    Use this template [TODO]().

- [.github](https://github.com/gitops-ci-cd/.github) Repository

    This is a special repository within GitHub that provides functionality across the organization.

    - [Customizing Organization Profile](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile)
    - [Creating Default Community Health Files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)
    - [GitHub Action Workflow Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/creating-workflow-templates-for-your-organization)
    - [Reusing GitHub Action Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows)

- [.github-private](https://github.com/gitops-ci-cd/.github-private) Repository

    This is another special repository within GitHub that [extends profile customization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#adding-a-member-only-organization-profile-readme).

## Development Workflow

1. Feature Development and Pull Requests

    - Developers work in feature branches within the app repository.
    - When a pull request (PR) is opened, a GitHub Action initiates linting and unit testing.

1. Automatic Preview Deployments

    - The [Argo CD PR Generator](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/applicationset/Generators-Pull-Request/) detects PRs labeled with "ephemeral" and generates a preview environment for the specific PR branch.
    - The PR-specific environment allows for isolated testing and review.
    - Upon successful deployment, [Argo's Notification tooling](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/notifications/) sends [deployment status updates to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/deployments), notifying the PR's deployment with statuses `in_progress`, `success`, `failure`, or `error` for real-time feedback on the preview environment.
    - The preview deployment is torn down upon removing the aformentioned label or closing the PR.

1. Releasing to Production

    - Once the PR is approved and merged to main, a GitHub Action builds a production-ready image, tags/releases the repo, and triggers a [deployment](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/deployments) workflow targeting production.
    - The release serves as an artifact of the build, versioned and traceable for production use.

This flowchart provides some insight into the "pipeline" of events that trigger CI and CD. The numbers represent the order that deployments happen.

        argo-app ---o app-deployment
        argo -- 2 --> deployment-status

        pr -- closed --> app
    end
```

## Production Deployment Workflow

1. New Image Detection

    - The new image tagged in the release is automatically detected by [Argo CD Image Updater](https://argocd-image-updater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
    - Argo CD Image Updater submits a PR to the [app]-deployment repository with the updated image tag. This PR can be set for manual approval or configured for auto-merge, depending on team practices.

1. Deployment to Production

    - Upon merging to main, Argo CD picks up the updated deployment configuration and rolls out the new image to the production environment.
    - [Argo's Notification tooling](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/notifications/) then sends [deployment status updates to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/deployments), notifying the deployment with statuses `in_progress`, `success`, `failure`, or `error`.

## Summary

These pipelines leverages GitOps principles and automated deployments to ensure a streamlined, consistent deployment process:

- Preview environments for each PR with isolated, PR-specific deployments.
- Automated versioning and tagging upon merging to main, ensuring each production release is traceable.
- Argo CD Image Updater PRs to enforce review controls for production changes or enable auto-rollouts.
- GitHub Deployment Statuses reflect the deploymentâ€™s lifecycle, from feature development through production deployment, providing continuous feedback and visibility.

The repositories herein combine GitOps with automated CI/CD workflows, providing both flexibility and control over each stage of deployment, while ensuring the system remains fully traceable, auditable, and GitHub-centered.
